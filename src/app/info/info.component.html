		<!-- <p>Welcome to the official page for the 18-hour long AppHack code festival held at Appalachian State University. AppHack is part of a shared effort to increase tech entrepreneurship, tech savviness, and code literacy worldwide. At AppHack, teams of students get involved in the software development process in whichever way that they can contribute. This process spans across design, development, and marketing disciplines. There are several products that have come from such events that are currently in use for everyday needs. In addition to being a highly productive environment, AppHack is loads of fun! There you will also find avid video gaming, free food all night long, and coffee-driven comraderie. AppHack is hosted as a joint operation between the Women in Computer Science club (WICS), and the Appalachian Society for Computing, Informatics, and Innovation (ASCII). We hope to continue the fantastic legacy of AppHack, and strive to continually improve the AppHack experience for all.</p> -->
